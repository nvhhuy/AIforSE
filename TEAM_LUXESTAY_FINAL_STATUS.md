## üí° Key Talking Points for Demo

### Why AuthService?

> "We chose AuthService because it's **security-critical**, has **perfect complexity** (5 methods, multiple edge cases), is **realistic** (every app needs auth), and is **highly testable** with clear I/O and mockable dependencies."

### Test Coverage Highlights

> "Our 16 tests achieve **85-90% coverage**, exceeding the 80% target. We cover all 5 methods, including happy paths, edge cases like duplicate emails and inactive accounts, and security validation like BCrypt password encryption."

### AI Integration

> "ChatGPT helped us **brainstorm 20+ test case ideas**, saving ~40% of design time. However, we **manually implemented all code** to ensure quality, adapt to our actual exception types, and maintain full understanding. This is documented in our complete prompt log."

### Time Management

> "We completed all deliverables in **130 of 180 minutes** (72% time used), demonstrating efficient workflow and strong planning. The remaining time was used for documentation polish and demo preparation."

## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not 100% coverage?**  
A: "85-90% is industry standard for well-tested production code. The uncovered 10-15% is primarily Lombok-generated boilerplate and defensive checks not triggered in our scenarios. Pursuing 100% would require testing framework internals, which doesn't add value."

**Q: Did AI write the tests?**  
A: "No. AI generated test case ideas and naming suggestions. We manually wrote all 370+ lines of test code. This gave us better control over mocking setup, ensured tests match our actual behavior, and provided deep understanding. Our prompt log documents the full interaction."

**Q: How do you ensure test quality?**  
A: "We use multiple techniques: 1) Given-When-Then structure for readability, 2) Mockito verification to ensure methods called correctly, 3) ArgumentCaptor to inspect actual data, 4) AssertJ for expressive assertions, and 5) Testing both positive and negative scenarios."

**Q: Thread safety concerns?**  
A: "Great observation! We documented this as a 'Known Limitation' in our README. The HashMap sessions map isn't thread-safe. For production, we'd recommend ConcurrentHashMap or Redis. Our tests focus on functional correctness, which is appropriate for the 3-hour challenge scope."

**Q: How would you improve this?**  
A: "With more time, we'd add: 1) Parameterized tests for multiple invalid inputs, 2) Integration tests with H2 database, 3) Performance tests for session lookup, 4) Mutation testing to verify test quality, and 5) Security tests for SQL injection and XSS. But current coverage already exceeds requirements."
