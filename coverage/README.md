## 🎯 How to Generate Coverage Report

### Method 1: IntelliJ (What you used)

```
1. Right-click AuthServiceTest.java
2. Select "Run 'AuthServiceTest' with Coverage"
3. After tests complete, go to Run → Generate Coverage Report...
4. Save location: This creates htmlReport folder
```

### Method 2: Maven JaCoCo (Alternative)

```bash
cd be_hotel
mvn clean test
# Report at: target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## 📞 Questions About Coverage?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Why not 100% coverage?**  
A: Some Lombok-generated code and defensive checks aren't triggered. 85-90% is industry-standard for well-tested code.

**Q: Is this real coverage?**  
A: Yes! Generated by IntelliJ + JaCoCo. You can regenerate anytime by running tests with coverage.

**Q: Can we improve it?**  
A: Yes! Add tests for edge cases like null inputs, concurrent access, etc. But current coverage already exceeds requirements.
